<h1>Howto create your own ARAnyM setup from scratch</h1>

<p>We, ARAnyM developpers hear many horror tales about ARAnyM installation, configuration
and setup by beginners, or even people which know a lot about Atari computers.<br>
<br>
Maybe we should share knowledge about how we got a working configuration using
ARAnyM and pure Atari software? So let's start.

<a name="compilation"><h2>1 - Compilation, getting an ARAnyM binary</h2></a>

<p>If you are skilled enough to compile sources, you don't need any help, except
for knowing which elements you need to enable at configure time. [TODO].<br>
<br>
For now, I consider you got a binary for ARAnyM (either .exe or anything else that
can be launched).
</p>

<a name="firsttry"><h2>2 - First try</h2></a>

<p>If you do a fresh start (no existing configuration file), you'd better launch
ARAnyM from a console window (the black/white thing where you type mystical commands),
whatever your OS (Linux, win32, or MacOSX). It will be easier for you to know what
prevents ARAnyM from working.</p>

<pre>
$ aranym
ARAnyM 0.9.2pre1
Config file '/home/patrice/.aranym/config' not found.
The config file is created with default values. Edit it to suit your needs.
TOS image '/usr/local/share/aranym/ROM' not found.
EmuTOS image '/usr/local/share/aranym/etos512k.img' not found.
No operating system found. ARAnyM can not boot!
Visit http://emutos.sourceforge.net/ and get your copy of EmuTOS now.
Couldn't protect ROM
</pre>

<p>So what do have? First, it does not find its configuration file (the path to
this file is OS-dependent, it should written somewhere in the doc). On any Unix
system, it is '${HOME}/.aranym/config'. As the program says, it creates a default
one, so you only need to read where it is created, and then you'll have to edit it
to suit your needs.<br>
<br>
You'll also get a default nvram setting, which is VGA monitor, 320x200x16 colors
boot screen and some other default setting for date format, keyboard and country.
You can change it by using a nvram utility like 'bootconf.prg' <a href="#link1">[1]</a>.
</p>

<a name="os"><h2>3 - Setup the operating system</h2></a>

<p>ARAnyM is only the hardware platform on which the Atari software will run. And
the first software to run before you can run an application is an Atari Operating
System:<br>
<br>
Original Atari machines and clones have an operating system residing in a ROM
chip on the motherboard: the TOS. ARAnyM supports only the 4.04 version of the TOS,
which is the latest produced by Atari for the Falcon 030. There are some dumping
software that can read it from your Falcon for use with ARAnyM.<br>
<br>
You can also use a more recent license-free operating system ROM image, that is
EmuTOS <a href="#link2">[2]</a>.<br>
<br>
The latest possibility is to use Linux/m68k kernel as an alternative OS. Running
it requires ARAnyM to be compiled with MMU (so you'll get no JIT, and using
MMU slows down the m68k emulation a lot) and Lilo (Linux loader) support.

<a name="os_tos"><h3>3.1 - TOS</h3></a>

<p>Just edit the config file, in the [GLOBAL] section, you'll find the 'TOS=' line
to fill with the complete path to a TOS 4.04 ROM image file. If you run ARAnyM with
it, after the Atari logo, you should reach the well-known GEM desktop.</p>

'EmuTOS=' line to fill with the complete path to a EmuTOS ROM image file. If you

usage using '-e' command-line parameter:</p>

<a name="os_linux"><h3>3.3 - Linux/m68k</h3></a>

<p>Linux/m68k settings have a special section [LILO] (for Linux loader), where
you have some work to do. You must provide the kernel image <a href="#link3">[3]</a> file to use (of
course) in the line 'Kernel='. A list of arguments to pass to the kernel to tell
it some infos about the system, in the line 'Args=', and a root filesystem.<br>
<br>
The 'Args=' line must be filled with some infos, like the Atari frame buffer format,
or more precisely, the video mode to use. Interleaved bitplanes formats are not
supported, so it must be either monochrome (use 'video=atafb:sthigh') or 16 bits
true colour mode.<br>
<br>
You also need to add 'console=tty0' if you enable debugging by adding 'debug
debug=&lt;debug device&gt;' for the Linux kernel to open the root console, or it
will fail to go further in the boot process once it has mounted its root
filesystem.
<br>
The root filesystem is the filesystem the Linux kernel will boot from, and is
required. It can be a ramdisk image file, a floppy disk, or a partition from a
hard disk. For ARAnyM, the floppy disk and the partition can be image files.<br>
<br>
Once these lines (Kernel, Args, maybe Ramdisk) are filled, you can start ARAnyM
with '-l' command-line parameter (wait a bit before Linux kernel starts)</p>
</p>

<a name="os_linux_rd"><h4>3.3.1 - Ramdisk image file</h4></a>

<p>Give to ARAnyM's linux loader the full path to a ramdisk image file <a href="#link3">[3]</a>
in the line 'Ramdisk='. It can be gzipped, no need to uncompress it yourself.<br>
<br>
You'll need to have 'root=/dev/ram load_ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=&lt;n&gt;' in the
'Args=' line. Replace &lt;n&gt; with a size in KB to allocate for the uncompressed
ramdisk in RAM, 8000 seems to be a good default value. In fact this value is the
size of the uncompressed ramdisk image. Remember you only have 14MB of STRAM, so
add at least 16MB of FastRam to ARAnyM if you want to try Linux/m68k. This is the
'FastRAM=' value in the [GLOBAL] section.<br>
</p>

<pre>
[LILO]
Kernel = /path/to/vmlinuz-2.2.25-atari
Args = root=/dev/ram load_ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=8000 [add some other arguments if needed]

</pre>

<a name="os_linux_fd"><h4>3.3.2 - Floppy disk or image file</h4></a>

<p>If you use the floppy disk image atari-root.img.gz from <a href="#link3">[3]</a>,
uncompress it using gunzip, then edit the configuration file this way, to boot from
the floppy disk image. You could also dd/rawcopy the image file to a real floppy
disk, and use 'Floppy =' to point to your real floppy drive.

<a name="floppy"><h2>4 - Create and setup a floppy disk image</h2></a>

<p>If your system does not have a floppy drive, or the direct floppy usage is not
supported on your system - i.e. not win32 and Linux/Unix (correct me if it's wrong -,
then your only option to start some Atari software is by using floppy disk images.<br>
<br>
The floppy image can be selected in Aranym GUI, press 'Pause' (or the OS-dependent key
which has this feature, read the doc), and go to disk submenu. This is the topmost
feature on this screen. Or you can edit the configuration file, line 'Floppy=' in
[GLOBAL] section.<br>
<br>
But we must create one first, before ARAnyM can use it.
</p>

<a name="floppy_linux"><h3>4.1 - Under Linux (and maybe other Unices)</h3></a>

<a name="floppy_linux_real"><h4>4.1.1 - From a real floppy disk</h4></a>

<p>Creating a floppy image from a real floppy disk is dead simple:</p>

<pre>
$ dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/path/to/floppy.img
</pre>

<a name="floppy_linux_scratch"><h4>4.1.2 - From scratch (top l33t!)</h4></a>

<p>First, we create an empty file, which has the same size as a 1.44 MB floppy.</p>

<pre>
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/floppy.img bs=1024 count=1440
</pre>

<p>Then, we format it (using either vfat or msdos file system):</p>

<pre>
$ /sbin/mkfs.msdos /path/to/floppy.img
</pre>

<p>It was easy to put files from an Atari system from a floppy disk to a floppy image.
But if we already have the Atari files on the host system, how can we put them on
the floppy image? Well, we mount it using the special loopback device:
</p>

<pre>
# losetup /dev/loop0 /path/to/floppy.img
# mount -t msdos /dev/loop0 /mnt
</pre>

<p>Note: only root user can create this special mapping, and now, your floppy image
is mounted in /mnt on your host system. You can copy your Atari files to it. When
you are finished with this transfer task, unmount the floppy image, and unset
the loop device:</p>

<pre>
# unmount /mnt
# losetup -d /dev/loop0
</pre>

<a name="floppy_otheros"><h3>4.2 - Some other OS</h3></a>

<p>[TODO]</p>

<a name="harddisk"><h2>5 - Create and setup a hard disk image (IDE emulation)</h2></a>

<p>I won't explain how to use a real hard disk from your old Atari computer, it is
safer to use a blank disk image to test. So, I will make it using TOS.</p>

<a name="harddisk_image"><h3>5.1 - Create the hard disk image</h3></a>

<p>Run ARAnyM, once you reach the GEM desktop, press 'Pause' (or the OS-dependent key
which has this feature, read the doc), and go to disk submenu. There you can choose
the floppy disk image, and one hard disk image for each IDE device (master and
slave).<br>
<br>
Select 'Path' and choose the location (and name) of the hd image. Then select the
size (in MB), and click 'Generate'. ARAnyM asks for confirmation, then does its job.
A geometry has been chosen for this hd image (C/H/S = 8/16/63). Enable it by selecting
the 'Present' checkbox. Select 'Apply' to go back to menu, then save the config
file. If you shutdown ARAnyM, and edit the config file, you'll find what has
been done in section [IDE0] of the config file.<br><br>
On a real machine, it means we have plugged an hard disk in our machine, it does
not mean there is software to drive it, which is the task of a hard disk driver.
EmuTOS has one embedded, whereas TOS has not. However, the hard disk image must be
partitionned to be used directly by EmuTOS:</p>

<pre>
$ aranym -e
ARAnyM 0.9.2pre1
Using config file: '/home/patrice/.aranym/config'
[snip]
hda: Non-ATARI root sector
[snip]
</pre>

<p>We need software to partition our hard disk image. Either from host side (with
host specific tools that must create an Atari root sector), or from Atari side
(using floppy disks or images to run software).</p>

<a name="harddisk_atari"><h3>5.2 - Partition the hard disk image (Atari side)</h3></a>

<p>We can use several Atari Hard Disk drivers:</p>

<ul>
<li>AHDI, from Atari (partition utility is named hdx) <a href="#link4">[4]</a> <a href="#link7">[7]</a>
<li>CBHD, from Steffen Engel <a href="#link4">[4]</a> <a href="#link5">[5]</a> <a href="#link7">[7]</a>
<li>Cecile, from Centek <a href="#link6">[6]</a>
<li>HD Driver, from Uwe Seimet <a href="#link1">[1]</a>, demo at <a href="#link4">[4]</a> <a href="#link5">[5]</a> <a href="#link7">[7]</a>
<li>SCSI tools, from Julian Reschke
<li>ADSCSI, from ICD <a href="#link7">[7]</a>
</ul>

<p>The question is, which ones work with ARAnyM?</p>

<a name="harddisk_atari_hdx"><h4>5.2.1 - Atari HDX 5.04</h4></a>

<p>I got one error message when going to menu Disk->Partition, and ARAnyM crashes:</p>

<pre>
hard drive: io read to address f00001 unsupported
hard drive: shouldnt get here!
Segmentation fault
</pre>

<a name="harddisk_atari_cecile"><h4>5.2.2 - Cecile 2.22</h4></a>

<p>First run cecile.prg, so the partition utility (cc_tools.prg) can access the
IDE hard disk. Run cc_tools.prg, select 'partition', then the first IDE hard disk.
Create one partition on this hard disk. Then select 'install' to install the cecile.sys
hard disk driver on it, selecting the first partition to boot from. Bingo, you
can reboot ARAnyM, and it is now booting from the IDE disk image.<br>
<br>
EmuTOS checks for partitions sizes against the whole disk size, and refuse to use
the disk if partitions have boundaries outside the disk. The last partition created
with Cecile on a hard disk has a wrong size (1 sector off limits), and if you
have only 1 partition created, its size is wrong, and EmuTOS won't use it. So create at least
2 partitions if you want to boot EmuTOS.
</p>

<a name="harddisk_atari_hddriver"><h4>5.2.3 - HD Driver 8.13</h4></a>

<p>You run hddriver.prg first, so that hddrutil.prg can access your hard disk.
Go to 'Hardisk' -> 'Partition...', select the IDE device and partition it. Don't
forget to install the driver on it to boot from it under TOS.<br>
<br>
Booting from EmuTOS also works with it.
</p>

<a name="harddisk_atari_cbhd"><h4>5.2.4 - CBHD 5.02</h4></a>

<p>Run 'cbhd.prg' for the utility to reach the IDE disk. Then run 'cbhdconf.app'.
When you try to partition, there are some errors coming from ARAnyM, and partitioning
fails:</p>

<pre>

<a name="harddisk_atari_scsitools"><h4>5.2.5 - SCSI Tools 6.52</h4></a>

<p>Run 'hushi.prg' to start the driver. Then run 'scsitool.prg' to partition the hard disk image.
Select 'Partitionen' -> 'Neu einrichten...' to create a new partition root sector for this image.
Select 'Standard' in the dialog box, then you got a new dialog box where you choose partition
types and sizes. Then select 'Ok' and 'Ja, partionieren...' to validate your changes.<br>
<br>
Now you have to install the driver. In 'Treiber' menu, select 'Instalieren...'. Select the new
partition where to install the hard disk driver. Once installed, reconfigure it so it does not
search for SCSI or ACSI drives ('Gerätereihenfolge' in installation dialog box). Just keep
I0 and I1 for IDE devices.<br>
<br>
Surprinsingly, no error messages from the IDE emulation layer. And the image boots with both
TOS and EmuTOS without problems.
</p>

<a name="harddisk_atari_icd"><h4>5.2.6 - ADSCSI</h4></a>

<p>Like other drivers, you need to run it first. The program is 'icdboot.prg'.
All other programs, like 'hdutil.prg' (for configuration) requires it to be run.
Unfortunately, it seems there is a problem with IDE emulation not suiting the
driver:
</p>

<pre>
IO write(f00000h): current command is 20h
IO read(f00000h) with drq == 0: last command was 20h
</pre>

<a name="harddisk_linux"><h3>5.3 - Partition the hard disk image under Linux</h3></a>

<p>Linux come with several partition utilities: mpartition (from mtools), cfdisk, fdisk, sfdisk,
parted and many more. All these tools will create a PC-like root sector on the hard disk image,
so not all Atari hard disk drivers can be installed on these.<br>
<br>
ID you can use for partitions are 04 (FAT16<32MB), 06 (FAT16), 83 (Linux) for the most useful for
an Atari system.<br>
<br>
EmuTOS supports the PC root sector format without an hard disk driver.
</p>

<a name="harddisk_linux_fdisk"><h4>5.3.1 - Using fdisk</h4></a>

<p>You need to give it the C/H/S parameters of the disk image, as written in ARAnyM config file.
In our case:</p>

<pre>
$ /sbin/fdisk -C 8 -H 16 -S 63 /path/to/harddisk.img
</pre>

<p>Press 'm' for some help. You need to create a partition (and choose its ID), then write the
created partition table to the image before quitting.</p>

<a name="harddisk_linux_sfdisk"><h4>5.3.2 - Using sfdisk</h4></a>

<p>You need to give it the C/H/S parameters of the disk image, as written in ARAnyM config file.
