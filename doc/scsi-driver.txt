ARAnyM provides a host component implementation of the SCSI Driver for ARAnyM
(Linux only).
The SCSI Driver standard is an open software interface for the Atari and was
initiated by Steffen Engel. Please refer to src/natfeat/nf_scsidrv.c and
http://hddriver.seimet.de/en/downloads.html for further information.

The SCSI Driver for ARAnyM implements a SCSI Driver on top of the Linux SG 3
driver interface. With the SCSI Driver software running within ARAnyM can
access all devices supported by the Linux SG driver. The ARAnyM user needs the
proper Linux permissions to access these devices. Depending on the Linux
distribution one may have to belong to the groups 'disk' and 'cdrom', for
instance.

The SCSI Driver for ARAnyM implements the SCSI Driver interface version 1.01.
It consists of two software components:

1. Native SCSI Driver host implementation, which for Linux is provided by
   ARAnyM. It maps SCSI Driver calls to Linux SG driver calls. In order to run
   the SCSI Driver stub for TOS on other platforms than Linux, this is the
   code that has to be ported.
2. SCSI Driver stub for TOS, HAT_SCSI.PRG. This component runs on TOS and
   uses ARAnyM's NatFeats interface to call the host driver. The stub is
   independent of the host platform ARAnyM is running on. HAT_SCSI can be
   downloaded from http://hddriver.seimet.de/en/downloads.html.

The NatFeats-based interface between the TOS stub and the host driver
implementation consists of 6 calls (NatFeats sub-ids):

1. SCSI_INTERFACE_VERSION

Returns the driver interface version number. (Note that this is not the same
as the SCSI Driver version.) Only if the host implementation and the TOS stub
interface version match, the stub can be installed. The format of the version
string is MAJOR.MINOR, coded as a 16 bit value. 0x0105, for instance, means
version 1.05.

2. SCSI_INTERFACE_FEATURES

Returns the host's bus features, which depend on the host system, and the bus
name. For Linux the bus name is "Linux Generic SCSI".

3. SCSI_INQUIRE_BUS, SCSI_OPEN, SCSI_CHECK_DEV

The host implementations of the corresponding SCSI Driver calls.

4. SCSI_INOUT

The host implementation of the SCSI Driver's In() and Out() calls. Except for
the data flow direction flag both calls are identical, so that they can be
mapped to the same interface call.

All SCSI Driver calls not listed above are implemented by the TOS stub.
Please refer to the source code (ARAnyM part and TOS stub) for details.
