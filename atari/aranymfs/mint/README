aranym.xfs
==========

This is the Atari-/MiNT-part of ARAnyM-fs.
The xfs consists of three parts:
    - file system to access the linux host file system (u:\nativefs)
    - device driver to access the linux modem device (u:\dev\serial2)
    - device driver for communication MiNT <-> ARAnyM (u:\dev\ara_com)

If you got aranym.xfs sources with ARAnyM note:
   - To compile the xfs you need the source tree of FreeMiNT (at least
     version 1.15.10b). Copy (symbolic link does not work!) all files
     of this directory to sys/xfs/aranymfs (last subdirectory should be
     new) at the FreeMiNT source tree. Call "make" after coping the
     files will make aranym.xfs.
