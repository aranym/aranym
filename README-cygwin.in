Hi all,

this is ARAnyM @VERSION@ for MS Windows. ARAnyM is (c) ARAnyM development team
(see DOC\AUTHORS.txt) and is distributed under the terms of GPL (COPYING.txt).

Please read the README.txt and NEWS.txt files in the DOC folder.
Some interesting technical information can also be found in the BUGS.txt
and TODO.txt files.

In this package you'll find three different binaries - standard aranym.exe,
MMU enhanced aranym-mmu.exe (good for running FreeMiNT with memory protection
or Linux-m68k) and JIT CPU compiler enhanced aranym-jit.exe (compiles m68k
code to i386 on-the-fly thus runs Atari applications lightning fast).

If you don't have a working and up-to-date Atari/ARAnyM setup yet then
go download the AFROS (8.12 or newer) now. It will boot to a nice GEM desktop.

ARAnyM for MS Windows stores its configuration in user's "Documents" folder
in subfolder named "aranym" by default (unless instructed otherwise using the
"-c <filename>" command line parameter). The configuration is plain text file
and you can edit it freely with a suitable text editor (Notepad, for example).
Commented template of the config file is in DOC\config.txt file.

Complete online documentation is in Dokuwiki at https://github.com/aranym/aranym/wiki

Enjoy!
